# Calculator Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a console-based calculator written in Python.  
It allows the user to perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  
The main goal of the project is to practice using Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub.

## 2. Development Process (How I Built It)

### 2.1 Planning
- Decided to create a text-based, menu-driven calculator.
- Listed required operations: +, -, ×, ÷.
- Planned to keep the code simple and beginner-friendly.

### 2.2 Implementation
- Created `Calculator.py`.
- Wrote separate logic to handle each operation.
- Used a loop so the user can perform multiple calculations.
- Displayed a clear menu and took user input using `input()`.

### 2.3 Error Handling & Testing
- Tested with different numbers (positive, negative, decimals).
- Checked how the program behaves if the user enters an invalid option.
- Handled division by zero by showing an error message instead of crashing.

### 2.4 Version Control
- Initialized a local Git repository.
- Added and committed files with meaningful commit messages.
- Planned to push the repository to GitHub for hosting and backup.

## 3. Features Implemented
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Menu-based interface with a loop.
- Exit option to stop the program.
- Simple error handling for invalid menu choice and division by zero.

## 4. Future Improvements
- Add more operations (power, modulus, square root).
- Improve input validation using functions.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Add automated tests to verify each function.
